# Database client examples for WasmEdge

Based on WasmEdge's [non-blocking network socket API](https://wasmedge.org/book/en/dev/rust/networking-nonblocking.html) and a Tokio-like [async runtime](https://github.com/WasmEdge/wasmedge-async), 
we are able to port popular database drivers and clients for the WasmEdge Runtime. This repo is a collection of examples accessing databases from inside WasmEdge applications.
